A production-ready Bitcoin state detection system using a 6-layer neural network to predict current market state (UP/DOWN/SIDEWAYS) and momentum strength with 95.3% accuracy.

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes last 5 hours of BTC price/volume data
- Extracts 22 technical features
- Predicts: Direction (UP/DOWN/SIDEWAYS) + Momentum Strength (0-100)
- Updates every 30 seconds in real-time
- Shows probability distribution for each direction
- Indicates "lean" when sideways (e.g., "sideways but leaning UP")

**Technology Stack:**

## How It Works (Quick Summary)

### Training (Already Done):
1. Fetch 2.5 years of BTC 1-minute price/volume data from Prometheus
2. Create sliding 5-hour windows, sampled every 30 minutes → 1,276 samples
3. Extract 22 features from each window
4. Look 1 hour ahead to label: UP (+0.3%), DOWN (-0.3%), or SIDEWAYS
5. Train 6-layer neural network (sklearn)
6. Validation: 95.3% accurate on unseen data

### Prediction (Real-Time):
1. Fetch last 6 hours of BTC data (360 data points)
2. Extract 22 features from last 5 hours (300 data points)
3. Scale features using trained scaler
4. Run through model → Get direction + strength
5. Display with probabilities and "lean" indicator
6. Update every 30 seconds

## The 22 Features (Grouped)

**Price Derivatives (12):**
- deriv_5m, deriv_15m, deriv_30m, deriv_1h, deriv_4h (% change)
- deriv_norm_5m, deriv_norm_15m, deriv_norm_30m, deriv_norm_1h, deriv_norm_4h (normalized)

## Important Context from Development

### Journey to This Model:
1. **Started:** Simple directional prediction model (too conservative)
2. **Tried:** Adding weighted derivatives, aggressive thresholds (too aggressive)
3. **Pivoted:** Mean reversion strategy, momentum detection (rule-based)
4. **Breakthrough:** Neural network for state detection (current approach)
5. **Iterations:**
   - Fast (3 layers, 93.7%)
   - Deep (4 layers, 95.0%)
   - Ultra-Deep (6 layers, 95.3%) ← **Current**
   - Tried 10+ layers (didn't improve, took too long)

### Why 6 Layers?
- **3 layers:** 93.7% (good but not great)
- **6 layers:** 95.3% (+1.6% improvement)
- **10+ layers:** Expected +0.2-0.7% (diminishing returns)
- **Training time:** 4 seconds (perfect for retraining)
- **Sweet spot:** 6 layers balances accuracy, speed, simplicity

### Why sklearn, not PyTorch?
- **Tried:** PyTorch with MPS (Apple Silicon GPU) for 10-layer model
- **Problem:** 10+ hours training time (20x slower than expected)
- **Root Cause:** MPS backend is immature, slow for residual networks
- **Decision:** sklearn is faster, simpler, and 95.3% is already excellent
- **Inference:** CPU is perfect (0.1ms), GPU would add overhead

### Key Insight: State Detection, Not Prediction
- **Original goal:** Predict future prices (didn't work well)
- **Better approach:** Detect current state accurately
- **Why:** Markets are unpredictable long-term but have identifiable current states
- **Result:** 95.3% accuracy detecting current momentum/trend

## Common Tasks & Commands

### Run Real-Time Monitor:
```bash
cd "/Users/mazenlawand/Documents/Caculin ML"
source btc_direction_predictor/venv/bin/activate
python monitor_combined_realtime.py
```

### Quick Prediction:
```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from feature_extractor import extract_features

# Load models
with open('direction_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    direction_model = pickle.load(f)
with open('strength_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    strength_model = pickle.load(f)
with open('scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

# Prepare data (5 hours of 1-minute data)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'price': price_array,    # 300 values
    'volume': volume_array   # 300 values
})

# Extract features
features = extract_features(df)
feature_names = sorted(features.keys())
X = np.array([[features[fn] for fn in feature_names]])
X = np.nan_to_num(X, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0)
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)

# Predict
direction = direction_model.predict(X_scaled)[0]  # -1, 0, or 1
strength = strength_model.predict(X_scaled)[0]     # 0-100
proba = direction_model.predict_proba(X_scaled)[0] # [down%, none%, up%]

# Interpret
direction_label = {-1: 'DOWN', 0: 'NONE', 1: 'UP'}[direction]
confidence = proba[direction + 1]

print(f"Direction: {direction_label} ({confidence*100:.1f}% confidence)")
print(f"Strength: {strength:.1f}/100")
print(f"Probabilities: DOWN {proba[0]*100:.1f}%, NONE {proba[1]*100:.1f}%, UP {proba[2]*100:.1f}%")
```

### Retrain Model (when you have new data):
```bash
cd btc_ultra_deep_detector
python train_ultra_deep.py  # Takes 4 seconds

# Copy new models to production
cp *.pkl ../btc_state_detector_production/
cp feature_names.json ../btc_state_detector_production/
```

- ❌ Slow training (10+ hours unacceptable)
- ❌ Complex PyTorch implementations
- ❌ Predicting future prices (too hard, doesn't work well)

### User's Tech Level:
- Comfortable with Python, terminal, ML concepts
- Appreciates detailed explanations with examples

- **OS:** macOS 24.5.0
- **Python:** 3.13
- **venv:** btc_direction_predictor/venv

### Data Source:

---

## Known Issues & Quirks

### Volume Data:
- Sometimes volume is 0 or missing
- When volume = 0, all volume features = 0 (handled gracefully)
- Model still works with 18 non-volume features

### Data Fetching:
- Network is the bottleneck (~500-2000ms)
- Occasional fetch failures (handled with retry)
- Need minimum 300 data points (5 hours)

### Sideways Detection:
- NONE (sideways) is hardest to detect (90.1% vs 98.2% for UP)
- Reason: Sideways is transition state, less distinct pattern
- Solution: Added "lean" indicator to show directional bias

### MPS GPU (Apple Silicon):
- Don't use PyTorch MPS for deep networks (20x slower!)
- CPU with sklearn is faster and simpler
- GPU only useful for TRAINING very deep models (not needed here)

## Future Improvements (If Needed)

### Better Features (More Impact Than More Layers):
1. **Sentiment data** - Twitter, Reddit, news sentiment
2. **Order book data** - Buy/sell pressure, market depth
3. **On-chain metrics** - Whale movements, exchange flows
4. **Funding rates** - Futures market sentiment

### More Data:
- Extend training to 5 years (double samples)
- Add multiple symbols (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- Include macro data (DXY, stock market)

### Ensemble:
- Combine Fast + Deep + Ultra-Deep predictions
- Often better than one large model
- Already have all 3 trained!

### Don't Do:
- ❌ More layers (diminishing returns after 6)
- ❌ PyTorch (too slow, no benefit)
- ❌ GPU (overkill for inference)
- ❌ Predicting future prices (doesn't work well)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Models not found":
```bash
# Models are in btc_state_detector_production/
# Make sure you're loading from the right directory
```

### "Feature mismatch" (X has N features, expecting M):
```bash
# Check that feature_extractor.py generates exactly 22 features
# Use the same feature_extractor.py that was used during training
# Don't modify feature calculation without retraining
```

### "Low accuracy in production":
```bash
# Check if market conditions have changed significantly
# Consider retraining on recent 2.5 years
# Monitor combined_signals_log.csv for drift
```

### "Slow predictions":
```bash
# Bottleneck is network (data fetch), not model
# Model prediction is ~0.1ms, network is ~500-2000ms
# Consider caching or local data if fetching too slow
```
