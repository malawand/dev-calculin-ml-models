# 🚀 Incremental Training is NOW RUNNING!

**Started**: 2025-10-17 ~17:50 UTC  
**Status**: ✅ Running in background  
**ETA**: 2-4 hours (20 iterations × 6-12 min/iteration)

---

## 📊 What's Happening

The system is now **actively training** and will:

1. **Start with 3 features** (deriv30d_roc, volatility_24, avg14d_spread)
2. **Train baseline model** (~52-54% accuracy expected)
3. **Add features one-by-one** (20 iterations max)
4. **Test each candidate** (try top 3 per iteration)
5. **Keep only if improves** (>0.1% accuracy gain)
6. **Stop when optimal** (5 iterations without improvement)

---

## 🎯 Current Configuration

```yaml
Starting Features: 3
Max Features: 20
Max Iterations: 20
Stop After No Improvement: 5 iterations
Min Improvement Threshold: 0.001 (0.1%)

Data: 16,899 samples with 424 features
Horizon: 24h (predict price direction 24 hours ahead)
Train/Test: 80/20 split (time-series aware)
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria

### ✅ Good Result
- Find 5-10 features that work well together
- Match baseline accuracy (58.36%)
- Clear understanding of which features matter

### 🚀 Exceptional Result
- Beat baseline (>58.36%) with fewer features
- Simple, interpretable model
- Strong candidates: long-term derivatives, volatility, momentum

## 📊 Comparing to Baseline

| Model | Features | Accuracy | Method |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Baseline** | 9 (LightGBM-selected) | 58.36% | Tree-based selection |
| **LSTM-50** | 50 (LSTM-selected) | 53.01% | Neural net permutation importance (overfit!) |
| **Incremental** | TBD | TBD | Start minimal, add greedily |

**Goal**: Beat baseline with simpler model!

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Check if still running:
```bash
ps aux | grep incremental_simple
```

### View errors:
```bash
tail -100 /Users/mazenlawand/Documents/Caculin ML/btc_minimal_start/logs/training_live.log
```

### Restart if needed:
```bash
cd "/Users/mazenlawand/Documents/Caculin ML/btc_minimal_start"
source venv/bin/activate
python3 incremental_simple.py > logs/training_restart.log 2>&1 &
```

## 📝 Notes

- Training is **fault-tolerant** - saves progress after each iteration
- Uses **time-series split** - no look-ahead bias
- **Early stopping** built-in - won't overtrain
- **Minimal resource usage** - runs on CPU, ~2GB RAM

---

## 🎓 What We'll Learn

After training completes, we'll know:

1. **Minimum Viable Features**: What's the smallest set that works?
2. **Feature Value**: Which derivatives/indicators actually help?
3. **Optimal Complexity**: 3 features? 10 features? 20 features?
4. **Diminishing Returns**: At what point do features stop helping?

---

## 📞 When to Check Back

- **In 30 minutes**: See baseline + first few iterations
- **In 2 hours**: See if model has found good features
- **In 4 hours**: Training should be complete

**Status**: 🟢 RUNNING  
**Location**: `/Users/mazenlawand/Documents/Caculin ML/btc_minimal_start/`  
**Log**: `logs/training_live.log`  
**Results**: Will be in `results/incremental_final.json`
