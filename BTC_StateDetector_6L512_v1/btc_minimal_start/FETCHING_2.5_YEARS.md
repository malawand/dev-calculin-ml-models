# ðŸ“Š Fetching 2.5 Years of Data - IN PROGRESS

**Status:** FETCHING NOW  
**Date Range:** April 2023 â†’ October 2025  
**Duration:** ~2.5 years (~910 days)  
**Expected Samples:** ~60,000-70,000 (15-minute bars)  
**Fetch Method:** 90-day chunks to avoid timeouts  
**Expected Duration:** 10-20 minutes

## Why 2.5 Years?

We already achieved **76.46% accuracy** on 1.8 years of data, which is excellent. But with 2.5 years we can:

1. âœ… **More market regimes** - Cover more bull/bear cycles
2. âœ… **Better validation** - More diverse trading conditions
3. âœ… **Stronger confidence** - Confirm the model isn't period-specific
4. âœ… **Production confidence** - Know it works across longer timeframes

## What to Expect

### Best Case:
- Accuracy stays â‰¥75% on 2.5 years
- Same features remain optimal
- Even better generalization with more data
- **Conclusion:** Model is extremely robust, deploy immediately!

### Good Case:
- Accuracy 70-75% on 2.5 years
- Similar features but maybe different optimal count
- Still excellent for trading
- **Conclusion:** Model is solid, deploy with monitoring

### Realistic Case:
- Accuracy 65-70% on 2.5 years
- Features need adjustment for longer period
- Still useful but needs more work
- **Conclusion:** Continue development, maybe quarterly retraining

## Next Steps After Data Fetch

1. âœ… Verify data quality (check for gaps)
2. âœ… Run Option B (all 3 incremental experiments)
3. âœ… Compare results to 1.8-year performance
4. âœ… Analyze if features change with more data
5. âœ… Make final production decision
