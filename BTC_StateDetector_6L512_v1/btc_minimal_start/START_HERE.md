# 🚀 START HERE - Bitcoin Scalping Model

**Your model is trained and ready to use!**

---

## 🎯 Two Versions Available

### **predict_live_with_context.py** (RECOMMENDED ⭐)
- Uses last 1 hour of data
- Better accuracy (~65-70%)
- Detects momentum & reversals
- 2-3 seconds query time

### **predict_live.py** (Basic)

## ⚡ 3 Ways to Use Your Model

### 1. **Get a Single Prediction** (Easiest!)

```bash
cd "/Users/mazenlawand/Documents/Caculin ML/btc_minimal_start"
source ../btc_lstm_ensemble/venv/bin/activate
python predict_live_with_context.py  # RECOMMENDED - uses 1-hour context
# OR
python predict_live.py  # Faster but less accurate
```

**You'll see:**
```
🎯 BTC SCALPING SIGNAL - LIVE PREDICTION
📊 PREDICTION RESULT
   Direction:  UP
   Confidence: 78.5%

🚨 TRADING SIGNAL
   🔥 HIGH CONFIDENCE SIGNAL: BUY
   Action: Execute BUY with 1-2% position
```

**Then:** Execute the trade manually on your exchange!

### 2. **Monitor Continuously** (Recommended!)

```bash
python monitor_continuous.py
```

This checks every minute and alerts you when there's a trading signal. Leave it running in a terminal!

---

### 3. **API Server** (For Bot Integration)

```bash
python api_server.py
```

Then from your trading bot:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/predict
```

## 🎯 Quick Examples

### Example 1: Manual Trading

```bash
# 1. Get signal
python predict_live.py

# Output: BUY at 78% confidence
# 2. Go to your exchange
# 3. Buy $200 worth of BTC (if you have $10k capital = 2%)
# 4. Set stop-loss at -0.12%
# 5. Set take-profit at +0.16%
# 6. Wait 15 minutes
# 7. Repeat!
```

### Example 2: Automated with Python

```python
from predict_live import predict

# Get prediction
result = predict()

if result['should_trade']:
    print(f"TRADE: {result['action']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.1%}")
    
    # Your trading code here
    if result['action'] == 'BUY':
        exchange.buy(amount=0.01, stop_loss=0.0012, take_profit=0.0016)
    elif result['action'] == 'SELL':
        exchange.sell(amount=0.01, stop_loss=0.0012, take_profit=0.0016)
```

### Example 3: Webhook Integration

```bash
# Start API server
python api_server.py &

# Call from TradingView, webhook, etc
curl http://localhost:5000/predict

### Common Issues

**"No data for metric"**
- Model will use 0 for missing data
- Still works but slightly less accurate

**"Connection error"**
- Check Cortex is running: `curl http://10.1.20.60:9009/api/v1/query?query=crypto_last_price`
- Update CORTEX_URL in `predict_live.py` if needed

**"How often should I check?"**
- Model is for 15-minute timeframe
- Check every 1-15 minutes
- Use `monitor_continuous.py` to automate
