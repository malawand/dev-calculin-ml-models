# 🚀 Incremental Training System - Status

## 📊 Current Status

**Status**: Creating simplified training system  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Goal**: Find optimal feature set by starting with 3 features and adding incrementally

---

## 🎯 What I'm Building

An incremental feature training system that:

1. **Starts Minimal**: Begin with just 3 features
   - `deriv30d_roc` - Long-term trend
   - `volatility_24` - Market volatility  
   - `avg14d_spread` - Mean reversion

2. **Adds Incrementally**: One feature at a time
   - Rank remaining features by correlation with target
   - Try top 3 candidates
   - Keep feature ONLY if accuracy improves
   - Stop after 5 iterations with no improvement

3. **Finds Optimal Set**: Simpler model that works better
   - Target: Beat 58.36% baseline with fewer features
   - Expect: 5-10 features vs 419 available
   - Benefit: Less overfitting, faster training, more robust

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Data Loading
**Problem**: Multiple ways to load data across different modules  
**Solution**: Need to use consistent data pipeline from btc_direction_predictor

### Challenge 2: Feature Engineering API
**Problem**: FeatureEngineer signature mismatches across attempts  
**Solution**: Use pre-engineered data from btc_lstm_ensemble or match exact API

### Challenge 3: Data Gaps
**Problem**: Yahoo Finance only provides 60 days of 15-minute data  
**Solution**: Skip gap filling, work with existing Cortex data

## 🎓 The Approach

### Why Incremental?

**Traditional Approach** (what we did before):
- Start with 419 features
- Let LightGBM/LSTM pick features
- Hope for the best
- Result: Complex, possibly overfit

**Incremental Approach** (what we're doing):
- Start with 3 carefully chosen features
- Add one at a time, keep only if helps
- Build up to optimal set
- Result: Simpler, more robust, interpretable

### Expected Outcome

| Iteration | Features | Expected Accuracy |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| 0 (baseline) | 3 | ~52-54% |
| 5 | 8 | ~54-56% |
| 10 | 13 | ~56-58% |
| 15-20 (final) | 5-15 | >58% |

**Success**: Beat 58.36% with <10 features

## 🚧 Current Work

Working on simplified version (`incremental_simple.py`) that:
- ✅ Uses existing data properly
- ✅ Simple LSTM architecture
- ✅ Clean incremental logic
- 🔄 Fixing FeatureEngineer API calls
- ⏳ Ready to run long training session

---

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Fix data loading** - Use btc_lstm_ensemble data pipeline correctly
2. **Run baseline** - Train with 3 features to establish baseline
3. **Run incremental** - Add features one by one for 20 iterations
4. **Analyze results** - Which features actually matter?
5. **Compare to baseline** - Did we beat 58.36%?

---

## 💡 Key Insights So Far

1. **Simple > Complex**: The 58.36% baseline uses only 9 features
2. **LightGBM beats LSTM on feature selection**: Tree-based picks better
3. **Too many features = overfitting**: LSTM with 50 features → 53% (worse!)
4. **Start minimal**: 3 features is the absolute minimum viable signal

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Minimal Success
- ✅ System runs without errors
- ✅ Can train with 3 features
- ✅ Can add features incrementally

### Good Success
- 🎯 Find feature set that matches 58.36%
- 🎯 Use fewer than 9 features
- 🎯 Clear understanding of which features matter

### Exceptional Success
- 🚀 Beat 58.36% with <7 features
- 🚀 Faster training than baseline
- 🚀 More robust to new data
- 🚀 Simple, interpretable model

## 📝 Notes

- **Data**: Using 1 year of 15-minute bars from Cortex (40,109 samples)
- **Target**: `label_24h` (predict if price goes UP or DOWN in 24 hours)
- **Validation**: 80/20 train/test split (time-series aware)
- **Model**: 2-layer LSTM with 32 hidden units (smaller than baseline)
- **Training**: 15 epochs per iteration, early stopping after 3 no-improve

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**ETA**: Will run for several hours to complete all iterations  
**User**: Can check back anytime to see results!

## 🔍 How to Monitor

While training runs:

```bash
# Watch live progress
cd btc_minimal_start
python3 monitor_progress.py

# Check raw logs
tail -f logs/incremental_simple.log

# View results so far
cat results/incremental_final.json
```
