## 💡 **Why Aggressive Model Works Better**

### 1. Class Balancing (`class_weight='balanced'`)
- Penalizes model for ignoring minority classes
- Forces learning of UP/DOWN patterns
- Prevents "always predict sideways" syndrome

### 2. Lower Thresholds (±0.08% vs ±0.20%)
- More examples of UP/DOWN movements
- 41% UP, 41% DOWN, 18% SIDEWAYS (balanced!)
- Model learns actual patterns vs noise

### 3. Better Scoring Formula
- Rewards UP/DOWN detection (20% weight)
- Prioritizes directional accuracy (40% weight)
- Doesn't over-optimize for overall accuracy

### 4. More Complex Model
- 30 leaves, depth 6 (vs 20/5)
- Can learn more nuanced patterns
- Captures smaller price movements
