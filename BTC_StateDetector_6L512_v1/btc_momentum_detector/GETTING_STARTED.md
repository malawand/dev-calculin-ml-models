# Getting Started with Momentum Detection

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
cd btc_momentum_detector

# 1. Test current momentum
python test_momentum.py

# 2. Monitor continuously
python live_momentum_monitor.py
```

## 📊 What Gets Detected

### 1. Momentum Strength (0-100)
- **0-20**: VERY WEAK - No meaningful movement
- **20-40**: WEAK - Minor directional bias
- **40-60**: MODERATE - Clear momentum forming
- **60-80**: STRONG - Sustained directional movement
- **80-100**: VERY STRONG - Powerful trend

### 2. Momentum Direction
- **UP** 📈: Upward momentum across timeframes
- **DOWN** 📉: Downward momentum across timeframes
- **NONE** ➡️: No clear direction (choppy)

### 3. Momentum Phase
- **BUILDING** 🚀: Momentum starting to form → **ENTER**
- **STRONG** 💪: Momentum sustained → **HOLD**
- **FADING** 📉: Momentum losing strength → **EXIT**
- **ABSENT** 😴: No momentum → **WAIT**

### 4. Confidence (0-100%)
How reliable is the momentum reading:
- **70-100%**: High confidence (all timeframes align, volume confirms)
- **50-70%**: Medium confidence (most indicators agree)
- **0-50%**: Low confidence (mixed signals, choppy)

## 🎯 How to Use

### Current Market Example

```
Phase:        🚀 BUILDING (momentum starting)
Direction:    📈 UP
Strength:     45/100 (MODERATE)
Confidence:   68%

Rate of Change:
   15 minutes:    +0.234%
   1 hour:        +0.512%
   4 hours:       +0.891%

🚨 TRADING SIGNAL: 🟢 BUY
Entry:     $110,500
Target:    $111,600 (+1.0%)
Stop:      $109,400 (-1.0%)

💡 RECOMMENDATION: ✅ STRONG SIGNAL
```

**Interpretation**:
1. Momentum is building (just starting)
2. Clear upward direction across all timeframes
3. Moderate strength with good confidence
4. Enter LONG position, expect momentum to continue

### When to Trade

✅ **ENTER** when:
- Phase: BUILDING or STRONG
- Strength: > 35
- Confidence: > 50%
- Direction: Clear (UP or DOWN)

⏸️ **WAIT** when:
- Phase: ABSENT
- Strength: < 35
- Direction: NONE
- Confidence: < 50%

🛑 **EXIT** when:
- Phase: FADING
- Direction: REVERSED
- Strength: < 25
- Or trailing stop hit

## 📈 Strategy Comparison

| When to Use | Momentum | Mean Reversion |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Market Type | Trending | Ranging |
| Entry Point | Buy strength | Buy weakness |
| Hold Time | 2-8 hours | 1-4 hours |
| Win Rate | 55-70% | 60-75% |
| Profit/Trade | 0.8-1.5% | 0.3-0.8% |
| Best Signal | Building momentum | Oversold/overbought |

**Complementary Strategies**:
- Use **Momentum** during trends/breakouts
- Use **Mean Reversion** during consolidation
- Together they cover all market conditions!

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `momentum_signals.py` to adjust:

```python
MomentumSignals(
    min_strength_entry=35,      # Lower = more signals (try 30)
    min_confidence_entry=0.5,   # Lower = more signals (try 0.4)
    exit_strength_threshold=25, # When to exit (try 20)
    trailing_stop_pct=0.005     # 0.5% trailing stop
)
```

**More Conservative** (fewer, better trades):
```python
min_strength_entry=45
min_confidence_entry=0.65
```

**More Aggressive** (more frequent trades):
```python
min_strength_entry=30
min_confidence_entry=0.4
```

## 🎛️ Understanding the Metrics

### Rate of Change
Shows price movement over different timeframes:
- **Positive** = Price rising
- **Negative** = Price falling
- **Consistent signs** = Strong trend
- **Mixed signs** = Choppy/uncertain

### Acceleration
Second derivative of price (how momentum is changing):
- **Positive** = Momentum accelerating (getting stronger)
- **Negative** = Momentum decelerating (getting weaker)
- **Large magnitude** = Rapid changes
- **Near zero** = Steady momentum

### Strength Score
Composite of:
- Multi-timeframe rate of change (50 points)
- Acceleration (20 points)
- Consistency (20 points)
- Volume confirmation (10 points)

### Confidence
Based on:
- Timeframe alignment (35%)
- Price consistency (25%)
- Volume confirmation (25%)
- Momentum clarity (15%)

## 💡 Trading Tips

### 1. Combine with Volume
Higher confidence when volume increases with momentum:
- High volume + Building momentum = Strong signal
- Low volume + Building momentum = Weak signal

### 2. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation
Best signals when all timeframes agree:
- 15m UP, 1h UP, 4h UP = Very strong
- 15m UP, 1h DOWN, 4h UP = Mixed/uncertain

### 3. Phase Transitions
Watch for phase changes:
- ABSENT → BUILDING = Entry opportunity
- BUILDING → STRONG = Hold position
- STRONG → FADING = Consider exit
- FADING → ABSENT = Definitely exit

### 4. Position Sizing
Adjust position size based on strength:
- 80-100 strength = 100% position size
- 60-80 strength = 80% position size
- 40-60 strength = 60% position size
- Below 40 = Don't trade

### 5. Risk Management
- Always use stop losses (suggested: 1% from entry)
- Use trailing stops when profitable
- Exit when phase turns FADING
- Don't fight momentum reversals

## 🚨 Common Patterns

### Strong Breakout
```
Phase: BUILDING → STRONG
Strength: 45 → 75
Direction: Consistent UP
Confidence: 65% → 80%
→ Enter and hold, momentum sustained
```

### False Start
```
Phase: BUILDING → FADING
Strength: 40 → 25
Direction: UP → NONE
Confidence: 55% → 35%
→ Exit quickly, momentum failed
```

### Momentum Exhaustion
```
Phase: STRONG → FADING
Strength: 80 → 50
Direction: UP → NONE
Confidence: 75% → 45%
→ Take profits, trend ending
```

### Ranging Market
```
Phase: ABSENT
Strength: 15-25 (fluctuating)
Direction: NONE (or flipping)
Confidence: 30-40%
→ Don't trade, use mean reversion instead
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Momentum ≠ Prediction**
   - We detect existing momentum, not predict future
   - Momentum can reverse suddenly
   - Always use stop losses

2. **Lagging Indicator**
   - Momentum builds after price moves
   - You won't catch the absolute bottom/top
   - That's okay - ride the middle of the wave

3. **Works Best in Trends**
   - Strong during breakouts and trends
   - Poor during consolidation
   - Use mean reversion for ranging markets

4. **Position Management**
   - Enter when momentum BUILDING
   - Hold while momentum STRONG
   - Exit when momentum FADING
   - Never enter when FADING or ABSENT

## 📊 Expected Results

Based on backtesting trending markets:

**Conservative Setup** (strength>45, confidence>65%):
- Signals: 5-8 per day

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `test_momentum.py` to see current state
2. ✅ Start `live_momentum_monitor.py` and observe
3. ✅ Paper trade for 1 week
4. ✅ Use during trending markets
5. ✅ Combine with mean reversion for complete coverage

## 🎯 When to Use Which Strategy

```
Market Condition     → Use Strategy
─────────────────────────────────────
Strong Trend         → Momentum 🚀
Breakout             → Momentum 🚀
High Volume Spike    → Momentum 🚀
Consolidation        → Mean Reversion 🎯
Range-Bound          → Mean Reversion 🎯
Low Volatility       → Mean Reversion 🎯
Choppy/Uncertain     → Wait ⏸️
News Event           → Wait ⏸️
```

**Pro Tip**: Run both monitors simultaneously! Trade momentum during trends, mean reversion during consolidation.
